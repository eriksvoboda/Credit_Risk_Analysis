# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Purpose

Using the credit card dataset from LendingClub we used six machine learning models to predict credit risk. These models are:
  - RandomOverSampler
  - SMOTE
  - ClusterCentroids
  - SMOTEENN
  - BalancedRandomForestClassifier
  - EasyEnsembleClassifier

We assessed the performance of all six models and based on the data can make a recommendation regarding if they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results

### RandomOverSampler Model
